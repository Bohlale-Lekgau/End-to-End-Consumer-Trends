<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2></br>
E-commerce platforms experience significant revenue loss from abandoned shopping carts, with rates often exceeding 70% globally.The goal is to address the core issue of suboptimal conversion rates by uncovering patterns in consumer decision-making, ultimately aiming to boost retention.
Successful implementation reduces lost revenue from incomplete transactions and enhances customer satisfaction through tailored experiences. Metrics like churn rate reduction and CLV uplift validate project success
(the annual percentage rate at which customers stop subscribing to a service in this context)
